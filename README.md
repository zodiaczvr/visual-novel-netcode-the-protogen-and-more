#### info the game

Your game concept sounds incredibly rich and immersive! Exploring a vast world filled with different biomes and a cybernetically enhanced city created by Protogens offers players a wide range of environments to discover and interact with. The idea of having options with consequences adds depth to the gameplay, as players must carefully consider their choices, knowing they could impact the outcome of the story.

The inclusion of other visual novels within the game, each with its own twist, adds even more depth and replay value. It gives players the opportunity to explore different aspects of the universe you've created and experience unique stories and challenges.

As for feedback, it sounds like you're still in the experimentation phase, which is fantastic! One suggestion would be to focus on creating compelling characters with distinct personalities and motivations. Strong character development can enhance the player's connection to the story and make their choices feel more meaningful.

Additionally, pay attention to world-building details to make the universe feel cohesive and believable. Consistent rules and lore help immerse players in the game world and make their exploration more rewarding.

Overall, your concept has a lot of potential, and it's exciting to see where your experimentation takes you! If you have any specific aspects you'd like feedback on or if you need help brainstorming ideas, feel free to ask.

It sounds like you've got a really cool concept going for your visual novel game! Protogens are always intriguing, and mixing them with a futuristic, cybernetic city backdrop sounds visually stunning. The inclusion of heavy weaponry like a .50 cal and desert eagles adds a layer of action and intensity to the poster.

Since you mentioned you have some fixing to do, are there specific elements you're looking to tweak or improve? Whether it's adjusting colors, refining details, or anything else, feel free to share, and I can offer some suggestions or feedback!
